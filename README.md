# ESP32 Display Lab/Demo

In this exercise students will use the LCD display of the SaTC ESP32 kit to display information regarding the current temperature and humidity readings. This is based off of an Arduino project XXX.

Something to note is that the ESP-IDF arduino library, at the time of writing (6/1/23) only works with versions of ESP-IDF between *4.1* and *4.9*. Additionally, the workarounds to this problem are currently unstable.

## Anatomy of an Aduino Project

An Arduino project consists of at least two functions. The **setup** and **loop** functions. The entrypoint of the program is the **setup** functions, this is often used to configure the device and any attached components. Once the **setup** function has returned, the **loop** function will run, and will continue to be called each time it completes. This architecture is called the **super-loop**, and does not take advantage of the Real Time Operating System (RTOS) capabilities of the ESP32.

## Attempt to make into ESP project
We will need to use the ESP-IDF version 4.4 if we want to use it to build and flash this project.

1. Install the [arduino-esp library](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32
    ```
2. Install [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), we need to do this as the installed version at ``` /home/iot/esp/esp-idf ``` does not have the ``` release/v4.4 ``` branch which is necessary.
3. Enter the esp-idf repository, and switch the brach to ``` release/v4.4 ```
    ```sh
    git branch release/v4.4
    ```
4. Now follow the [install instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)
5. Set the ``` IDF_PATH ``` environment variable to the esp-idf version 4.4 folder.
    ```sh
    # Example 
    export IDF_PATH=/home/iot/esp-4.4/esp-idf
    ```
