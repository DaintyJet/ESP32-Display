# ESP32 Display Lab/Demo

In this exercise students will use the LCD display of the SaTC ESP32 kit to display information regarding the current temperature and humidity readings. This is a Arduino project with the ESP-IDF toolchain using the [ESP-Arduino Core](www.google.com) as a component.

Something to note is that the ESP-IDF arduino library, at the time of writing (6/1/23) only works with versions of ESP-IDF between *4.4* and *4.4.99* or 5.1. The branch for version 5.1 refers to the the pre-release version of esp-idf version 5.1, which may be unstable.

## Anatomy of an Aduino Project

An Arduino project consists of at least two functions. The **setup** and *loop* functions. The entrypoint of the program is the *setup* functions, this is often used to configure the device and any attached components. Once the *setup* function has ended and returned, the *loop* function will begin to run, and will continue to be called each time it completes a run. This is called a *super-loop* architecture , and does not take advantage of the Real Time Operating System (RTOS) capabilities of the ESP32.

## Start this project
1. Download the git repository and it's submodules.
    ```sh
    git clone <INSERT FINAL LINK HERE> && \  # Clone the repository 
    cd ESP-Display && \                      # Enter into repository folder
    git submodule init && \                  # Init submodules
    git submodule update                     # Install submodules
    ```


## Arduino as an ESP-IDF Component ESP version 4.4
We will need to use the ESP-IDF version 4.4 or 5.1 if we want to use the ESP-IDF to build and flash this project. The following are all necessary steps to add the Arduino core as a ESP-IDF component. **Note** that steps 1, 2, and 3 may have already been done for you.

1. Install the [arduino-esp library](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) into a folder named arduino
    ```sh
    cd components && \                                            # Enter into components folder                                           
    git clone https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32 arduino  # Clone arduino core
    ```
2. Install [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), we need to do this as the installed version at ``` /home/iot/esp/esp-idf ``` does not have the ``` release/v4.4 ``` branch which is necessary.
    ```sh
    cd ~ && \                                           # Enter into the home directory 
    mkdir esp-4.4 && \                                  # Make a folder for the 4.4 esp version
    cd es-4.4 && \                                      # Enter into the newly create folder
    git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git  # Clone esp-idf
    ```
3. Enter the esp-idf repository, and switch the brach to ``` release/v4.4 ```
    ```sh
    cd esp-idf && \          # Enter into esp-idf directory
    git switch release/v4.4  # Switch to the 4.4 release
    ```
4. Set the ``` IDF_PATH ``` environment variable to the esp-idf version 4.4 folder.
    ```sh 
    export IDF_PATH=/home/iot/esp-4.4/esp-idf  # Change the IDF_PATH to reflect the new PATH to the 4.4 version
    ```
5. Now follow the [install instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)
    ```sh
    # For simplicity we re-run the install script, there are some repetitive files, so we could use links instead 
    ./install.sh  # Install esp-idf components 
    . ./export.sh # Export shell variables to the shell (Be sure to use the one in the esp-4.4/esp-idf)
   ```
7. Configure mbedTLS
    ```sh
    #  Component config -> mbedTLS -> TLS Key Exchange Methods -> Enable pre shared-key ciphersuites
    #  Component config -> mbedTLS -> TLS Key Exchange Methods -> Enable PSK based ciphersuite modes
    idf.py menuconfig   
    ```
9. Run the idf.py build command in the ESP-Display project folder
   * This will install a number of components the first time you start a project 
   * If this fails for whatever reason (interrupted, exited, etc.) you can run the following command from the ```~/esp-4.4/esp-idf ``` directory
        ``` git submodule update --init --recursive ```

**Note when moving between versions**: run ``` idf.py clean ``` and ``` idf.py fullclean ```

## Arduino as an ESP-IDF Component ESP version 5.1
In this case we will do the same steps as listed above, only differing in some of the steps. (Because this is temporary, I will not list all of them)

(Note the initial time I did this it failed, after installing 4.4 and going back to this it did work - may not work without some tools in the chain from 4.4)

**We likely need to change the version used by the esp-idf VScode extension. This is due to the interconnected nature of the esp-arduino core, and the instability of changes I (Matt) would make.** 
**4.4 is more reliable and stable as compaired to the pre-release 5.1. I will need to check if the other labs work on the 4.4 release - if so we should switch. When switching make sure to remove the old sdk (possibly)**

1. Enter into the esp-idf directory
2. Switch the esp-idf repository to release version 5.1 
    ```sh 
    git switch release/v5.1
    ```
3. Enter into the ESP-Display directory 
    ```sh
    cd components/arduino 
    ```
4. Switch the branch used by the arduino repository
    ```sh
    git switch esp-idf-v5.1-libs
    ```
5. Modify the ``` Esp.h ``` File
    ```sh
    # Replace #include <esp_partition.h>
    # With #include</home/iot/esp/esp-idf/components/esp_partition/include/esp_partition.h>

    nano /home/iot/ESP32-Display/components/arduino/cores/esp32/Esp.h
    ```
6. Enabled backwards compatibility within FREERTOS
    ```sh
    # compoent config -> FreeRtos -> Kernel -> configENABLE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY 
    idf.py menuconfig 
    ```
7. Enable Enable pre-shaired-cipher suites 
    ```sh
    #  Component config -> mbedTLS -> TLS Key Exchange Methods -> Enable pre shared-key ciphersuites
    #  Component config -> mbedTLS -> TLS Key Exchange Methods -> Enable PSK based ciphersuite modes
    idf.py menuconfig   
    ```
8. Add necessary component dependency
    ```sh
    idf.py add-dependency "espressif/mdns^1.1.0"
    ```
**Note**: It did not require the pressing of the boot button when flashing

## Components 
Components used:

* Display: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library
   * We need to add a CMakeList.txt file in the display library so it will be discovered, and linked. This has already been done in this project (Hence why the library is a fork and submodule!) 
        ```
